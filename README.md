# Bank
A bank portal application

### Why did I build this app? 

I wanted to create a program that can help me organize my finances. At the moment I'm just writing everything down and I think It'll be fun
automize this part of my life. I also saw this cool design on dribbble and thought I could replicate it, and I did. Recenetly I've been trying to create exact
replicas of the designs I like. I think this is great practice to improve my front-end skills. 

## Technologies: 
1. React for the front-end
2. Material-Ui to speed up the design process (Icons, Styled components, Avatars, etc...)
3. Node.js for the back-end
4. Express to cut down on the time to create routes
5. MongoDB for non relational data (Authentication)
6. Postgresql for mostly all data related to the user besides authentication.
7. Redux for state management
8. React-router for front-end routing
9. DevExtreme Reactive for all the cool looking chars they have
10. Adobe fonts for well the fonts lol....

## Languages: 
1. JavaScript

### What will the app do?
1. The app can authenticate users
2. Allow users to record their financial history
3. Show user's financial history on charts and split them into catagories. 
4. Users can send money to others. (I haven't figured this part out yet, since creating a payment processor will take up a lot of my time so I'm just going to try 
something simple. At the moment I'm thinking of using something like the Stellar Network to send/recieve payments. It uses Stellar Lumens a crypto currency to 
create transactions. The benefit of this is that the transactions can be made globally (No need to worry about foreign currencies).)
4a. Or just use stripe... But Stellar sounds more fun to use.
5. Users can create plans to organize and save their finances.
6. Will show upcoming payments that are due.
7. Shows recent payments that have been completed.
8. I will definitely add more to this list. I have plenty of ideas I want to incorporate into this project.
